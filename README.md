Final Project for FEWD

Connect Four

For my final project, I will build a version of the popular game Connect Four.  

The game has two players that take turns placing one piece on the board.  The first player to get four pieces in a row wins the game.

To begin the game, there will be an input field to select your color, Red or Yellow.

If a player chooses Red he will go second.  If a player chooses Yellow he will go first.

The board will be a typical Connect Four board, with an X axis of 6 rows across, and a Y axis of 7 columns vertical.

The border of the game board will be the typical blue.  The spaces will be white and the pieces will be red and yellow.

The board will be a grid of A-F on the X axis, and 1-7 on the Y axis.

After a Player places a piece, the opponent will have the ability to place their piece above theirs.

The first player to get four pieces in a row wins the game.  At this point, a box will appear on the screen stating "Player ...  Wins the Game!"

There will also be another button that pops up beneath this alert which will be the Reset button.  

The Reset button will clear the board and allow either player again to choose either color Red or Yellow.
